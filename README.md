<h1 align="center">PetConnect</h1>
<h3>The PetConnect initiative presents a dynamic and easily navigable website aimed at pet
owners looking for information on a customized diet for their cherished animal friends.
Our platform strives to close the gap by providing thorough nutritional advice for a va-
riety of pets, in response to the increasing demand for precise and easily available pet
nutrition assistance. PetConnect streamlines the process of choosing the best diets for
pets, enhancing their general health and wellbeing, by utilizing an intuitive interface and
an extensive library of nutritional information unique to each pet. The construction,
functionality, and impact of the PetConnect website are examined in detail in this project
report, which also highlights how it addresses a significant demand in the pet care sector.</h3>
