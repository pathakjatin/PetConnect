        <h2>LABRADOR</h2>
        
        <P>The Labrador Retriever, or simply Labrador, is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.

            The Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]</P>

            <DIV id="dalmatian" style=background-color:beige>
            
        <P>The Dalmatian is a breed of dog,[2] which has a white coat marked with black or brown-coloured spots. Originating as a hunting dog,[3] it was also used as a carriage dog in its early days. The origins of this breed can be traced back to present-day Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia.[4] It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers and a spotted Great Dane.[5] Today, it is a popular pet and many enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.</P><BR><BR><BR>

        <H2>DOBERMAN</H2>
        <DIV id="doberman" style=background-color:beige>
        <p>The Dobermann (/ˈdoʊbərmən/; German pronunciation: [ˈdoːbɐman]) is a German breed of medium-large domestic dog of pinscher type. It was originally bred in Thuringia in about 1890 by Louis Dobermann, a tax collector.[2] It has a long muzzle and – ideally – an even and graceful gait. The ears were traditionally cropped and the tail docked, practices which are now illegal in many countries.

            The Dobermann is intelligent, alert and tenaciously loyal; it is kept as a guard dog or as a companion animal.[3] In Canada and the United States it is known as the Doberman Pinscher.</p>
