            On the face of it, home-cooked dog food might seem like the healthier option. You get to pick the
            ingredients and have complete control of the proportions as well as the cooking process. However, unless
            prepared by a veterinary nutritionist, home-cooked meals are inadequate in nutrients required by your pet
            for healthy growth and development. Besides this, it is also important to be aware of the common kitchen
            ingredients that are extremely unsafe for pets like caffeine, chocolate, grapes, raisins, garlic, onions,
            macadamia nuts, animal bones, and raw eggs.

            On the other hand, packaged puppy dog food offers guaranteed nutrition, digestibility, safety, palatability,
            diversity, and consistency. In fact, kibble is known to provide a better chew (as compared to soft
            home-cooked dog food) which is beneficial for dental health.

            A dog’s nutritional requirement differs depending on its size and the life stage they are in. Puppies are
            vulnerable and have unique needs. Hence they benefit most from quality puppy dog food with good ingredients
            like Pedigree® PRO. Made with superior ingredients, high protein, and an adapted kibble size, Pedigree® PRO
            helps meet the special needs of puppies, adult dogs, and senior dogs.

            So let’s delve into what to <b>feed a puppy</b> at every stage…

        <div class="foodpara">
            The newborn Doberman puppy weighs, on average, between 10ozs. and 20ozs. They, like other canids, are born
            with their eyes shut and their ears tightly creased and basically closed. They nurse constantly, usually
            every 1 to 2 hours—taking in small amounts— which helps to sustain their metabolism and their growth. They
            grow rapidly, gaining steadily throughout the puppy stage, which is considered the first 12 months of their
            life.
            Puppies should consume their mother’s milk for the first 3 weeks of their life. For the next two weeks after
            that, they can be offered a bit of puppy dog food, but their mom still needs to be feeding puppies most of
            their nutrition. From the age of 6 weeks onwards, they can start to eat part of their meals on their own and
            get part of their nutrients from their mother's milk. By 8 weeks, they can get most of their nutrition by
            themselves from puppy dog food. It’s important for a puppy’s development to get its mother’s milk in this
            initial stage. It builds their immune system and helps them get the right nutrients which set the stage for
            long-term health.

        <div class="foodpara">
            At about 6 to 7 weeks the first vaccinations are given. These usually include DHPP, which are all the major
            infectious diseases that affect puppies and also PARVO, which is a deadly disease of dogs, but especially of
            the young. It is highly contagious, as are Distemper and the others, and can quickly kill young pups through
            dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea. The 7 week old puppy is eating on his own about four meals, now. And
            he continues to grow and develop. Between 7 and 12 weeks—the Dobermans ears are cropped. This is an
            operation done by the Veterinarian that removes a large portion of the outside of the ear.

            At this stage, a pup’s immune system is very delicate which makes them susceptible to infections and loose
            stools.

        <div class="foodpara">
            At about 12 weeks of age, the Doberman starts the teething phase of its life. This continues for the next 3
            months as the baby teeth fall out and the new permanent ones come in. Often you will find teeth on the
            floor. More often the puppy will just swallow them. Don’t be alarmed, as this is normal. During this time
            the puppy can have swollen, bleeding gums and want to chew everything it can. This is the time to provide
            real bones, rawhides, pig ears and other safe things for the puppy to chew on.

            Adulthood
        </div>
        <div class="foodpara">
            The Dobermans lifespan is about 9.6 years, on average. The adult phase of their life is from one year old
            until the dog reaches about 7. During this mature phase the Doberman is at its peak and prime. These years
            are when the Doberman is most active, and is doing most of the family activities, show events such as
            Obedience and Agility and just enjoying life with his people.

            Large breeds reach adulthood at 18 months. At this stage they require adequate energy and nutrition to
            support their physical activity requirements and promote their peak life condition. Breeds like Golden
            Retrievers, German Shepherds, Labradors, Dobermanns & St.Bernards require energy to remain active all day
            long. That's why Pedigree® PRO Adult Large Breed is formulated with omega fatty acids and quality proteins
            to support alertness and agility. It also contains vital nutrients like magnesium, potassium, calcium,
            sodium, vitamins, and fatty acids to support healthy heart function. Large breeds need special care to
            ensure digestive health as their digestive physiology is different as compared to small breeds. Therefore,
            Pedigree® PRO also contains Prebiotic (MOS) to promote digestive health.
